Only a few hours, a math class, and (an admittedly long) car ride are between me and home. See you soon enough, 516!
Every time corn tweets, I think of @makeitgrane and @pTARA_dactyl_ #missyouguys
@lizzFlamingo All I want to do is listen to my music and research for summer scholars, but right now I'm doing a whole lot of waiting.
God forbid SJU wireless actually be functional in the library…
I get to see @the_okaygatsby @xxodrama and @AndrewWalsh_ in just over 48 hours! #almostreunited
Happy birthday to my favorite ginger @campfire_3! Have a super wonderful day :)
@the_okaygatsby You're going to like yours I think.
The only good thing about today is that I finally figured out what I was getting everyone for Christmas.
I'm very upset about McCann.  Somehow, I found it easier to root for him as a Brave than I will a Yankee.
I've read two books, totaling about 1,000 pages, in the past 24 hours. Once a bookworm, always a bookworm.
When you have chapel choir practice for almost longer than you slept last night #thestruggle #sjuprobs
Whatever I'm going to go home and blast Christmas music and sing whatever harmonies I want.
The arrangement of Joy to the World absolutely sucks. What was wrong with the old one?
Get me out of this choir session…
The chapel is like 30 degrees why is this okay?
This choir guy is off his rocker crazy… #5morehours
I forgot how absolutely perfect it is to sit down and read an entire book in one sitting. #bookwormforever #Divergent
Sometimes the right thing to do is the hardest.
@i_like_riek DON'T RUIN IT FOR ME MY COPY IS IN NY.
@the_okaygatsby @xxodrama I can't wait <3
I should be doing another two or so hours of homework… on that note, good night.
I'm ready to go to sleep and lab hasn't even started… do you think it's acceptable to sleep through van training?
@the_okaygatsby Like the green apple starburst jelly beans!
@HEARcomsthesun You are an absolute champion at school in general (and also I vote that you're a math kid because we're the best).
Aww bye @LaTroyHawkins32 the Mets will miss you :( At least you'll be on my second favorite team so I can still root for you.

@the_okaygatsby You could be a math major with me instead! :)
@matttykiiiiiid @i_like_riek The more the merrier! Will you be home Dec 17? :)

@fun_fetti THIS MAKES MY DAY. Can we start a countdown until we can enjoy this fantastic dinner date???
I'm sitting in my apartment on a 65 degree day wearing shorts and a t-shirt listening to Christmas music. #thisismylife

I mean I've been up for a solid two and a half hours so it's not like it woke me up, but why is there someone jack-hammering outside?
@Jules_George I'm partially lactose intolerant, there's a lot of lactose free stuff out there that's just as good!
My mom just texted me: Our dog keeps hearing cats on TV and running to the door barking thinking they're outside. I find that hysterical
I'll be cutting myself off of social media for today because this paper absolutely has to get done.  See you in a few hours, world.
@the_okaygatsby Stardust was an A+ movie good job and thanks
